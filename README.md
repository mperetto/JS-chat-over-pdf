# Chat PDF Clone

In this repository you will find a simple web app with functionalities similar to the ChatPDF service. The purpose of this repository is twofold:

1. To facilitate my university life by giving me the opportunity to ask questions about professors' handouts and learn more quickly.
2. To see the potential of langchain js and learn how to use it to its full potential with a practical project.

## Running the Project
